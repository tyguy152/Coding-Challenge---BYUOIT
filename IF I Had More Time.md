# Coding-Challenge---BYUOIT
 If I had more time the first thing I need to fix is putting all of what I had in main in a function. I had the code to be able to detect if the user or computer was able to 
 use the space they wanted, and I also had the code for the user to choose where they wanted to go. Both of those needed to be in functions so that I could've finished more easily.
 I had a function for my winChecker, but I needed to put the other code that I used with it in a function as well, because everytime that I used the winChecker, I had to see if
 they had won and if they had, whether they wanted to play again. The last thing I needed to make work better was my logic to show who won. Most of the time it would work totally
 fine, but occasionally it wouldn't quite work right, so if I had more time I would have debugged it better.
 Another thing that I would've done is make the computer smarter if I had time.
